#Boilerplate generators
This repository contains boilerplate generators for numerous types of projects (mostly web development). These will create the project directory, setup the build environment, and install packages/libraries.

The generators are currently intended for use on Linux only (it relies on UNIX shell tools like jq). Compatibility with macOS and Windows to be implemented and tested at a later date.
